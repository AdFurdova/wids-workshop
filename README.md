## Too easy? Try adding more complexity!

    # enrich the page layout, add texts, input fields, result metrics - be creative :)

    # add cats dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset - ask the user if he/she/it is a cat or dog person and display the result image based on the answer

    # push your project into GitHub repository and deploy your app to streamlit cloud https://streamlit.io/cloud

    # or simply publish your Deepnote project and share it around!
